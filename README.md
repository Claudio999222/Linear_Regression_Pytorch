# Linear Regression with PyTorch

This repository provides an in-depth exploration of linear regression using PyTorch, a powerful library for deep learning and machine learning tasks. Linear regression is a supervised learning algorithm used to predict a continuous value. This repository covers various aspects of linear regression, including model creation, loss function definition, parameter optimization, and application to real-world datasets.

## Features

- **Introduction to Linear Regression**: Understand the basics of linear regression, its structure, and how it differs from other supervised learning algorithms.
- **Model Creation**: Learn how to build a linear regression model using PyTorch.
- **Loss Function and Optimization**: Explore how to define a loss function (MSE) and optimize model parameters using the gradient descent algorithm.
- **Practical Examples**: Implement practical examples and tutorials to illustrate the use of linear regression in real-world scenarios.
